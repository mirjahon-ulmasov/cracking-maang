/*
You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).

In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].

Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.

Hint 1: Characters are independentâ€”only the frequency of characters matters.
Hint 2: It is possible to distribute characters if all characters can be divided equally among all strings.

// To make all words same, we need to have same number of characters in each word
// To find this, we need to count each characters in array, and mod it to length of array,
// Problem: ['abc', 'aabc', 'bc']
// a -> 3, b -> 3, c -> 3,
// Answer: Yes, since all characters count is 3, and 3 % arr.length = 0.
// It means, we can create same words
